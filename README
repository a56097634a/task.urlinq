How to input
Input the length of array in the texfield, and the textfield accepts all characters.
Number 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 will be considered as themselfs;
Numbers larger than 5 will be considered as 5;
Decimal Numbers will be considered as their integral part;  
Other characters will be considered as 0;

Result
When the input is 0, the back image will show up in the middle;
When the input is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the composite image with cropped image representations will show up in some format from right to left;
The image representation will be chosen randomly from 5 images in side main bundle, that is because the content of input array of objects does not matter;
Especially: when the input is 5, the left end of image queues will be covered with gradient layer which makes the fifth image looks like fading away.
